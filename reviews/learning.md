>DomContentLoaded :-The **DOMContentLoaded event** fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

>The original target for this event is the Document that has loaded. You can listen for this event on the **Window interface**(window api) to handle it in the capture or bubbling phases. 

>Other option was Load event ,but it's not the right choice here beacuse it will  be fired when all the html ,css is paresed also after the external css are loaded .
